# Land of Hop, Fastify API

🗓️ 04.09.2021

My third attempt to build perfect REST API for the Land of Hop beer catalogue application. I previously worked on it using Express and then Nest longer time. I should not complain about these two frameworks, they are great, but I am not satisfied how the code style looked using them. I believe it could be done more readable and scalable using Fastify.

## Developing

Install dependencies by

```bash

and start a development server:
